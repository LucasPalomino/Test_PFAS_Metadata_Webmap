Here is some more git information while you are reading this:

### Making Changes
1. **Edit files** - Make your changes as normal
2. **Stage changes** - In Source Control panel, click the "+" next to files you want to commit
3. **Commit** - Type a message in the text box at the top and click the checkmark (✓)
4. **Push** - Click the three dots (...) → Push

### Essential Rules

- **Commit often** - Small, frequent commits are better than large ones
- **Write clear messages** - "Fix login bug" not "updated stuff"
- **Pull before you push** - Always get the latest changes first
- **Check status regularly** - Use `git status` to see what's happening

Also you might come accross the concept of branching, but we will try keeping it simple and not use them.
